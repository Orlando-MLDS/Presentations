# Presentation-Topics
A list of previous and proposed presentation topics at Orlando MLDS meetups.

## Proposed

We are always looking for presentation topics. If you feel confident enough that you could talk about it for five minutes, chances are that it would make a good presentation. 

When listing, give a brief description along with your name and ODevs Slack name (or email if you dn't have one) so we can contact you. Also indicate approx length (15, 30, 45, ++) so we can schedule shorter talks together. While we prefer talks that include some sort of code or workshop material, it's not a requirement.
